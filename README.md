# stellar-enigma
A game engine that uses the SFML framework.

I created this engine for a game 


## Instructions:
To add custom behavior to the engine, modify the functions found in custom.cpp
These functions allow custom code to mostly be contained to one file



## Documentation:
Documentaion can be generated using Doxygen. Currently, only parts of the code
are documented, but I am working on fixing that

## Credits:
stellar-enigma was created by xavenna

I used the SFML framework for graphics and audio.
These libraries can be found at https://sfml-dev.org/
